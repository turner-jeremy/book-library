# book-library

The Odin Project Javascript Course - Library project

Notes for tomorrow:

- Change library layout to small cards in grid.
  
- They could be color coded depending on status.

- Need to iterate through whole library each time function is called rather than just adding next book to the end.

- Add edit function to delete or change status of book.
